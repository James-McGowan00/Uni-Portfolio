								<p> My second assignment was creating a recreation of an old Mario level from 1983  called Mario’s Cement Factory. </p>

								<h3> Characters </h3>
								<p> To create Mario and Luigi I first loaded them in from a sprit sheet. I did this by creating a mesh/ texture that would load Mario and Luigi when the game launched.
										This would allow Mario and Luigi to appear on the screen when the game launched. One change I made to Mario and Luigi was the height of the characters from the original design I made them taller than the original game.
										I made them move with different key bindings, so 2 people can play at the same time as well as making them face in the direction the player pressed.</p>

								<h3> Movement </h3>
								<p> I added movement to Mario and Luigi which allows them to both jump and move with individual controls. The jump allows both Mario and Luigi to jump to the next level to avoid the Koppers.
										With the side to side movement this allows both Mario and Luigi to wrap around the map transporting to the other side.
										Mario and Luigi both have the ability to hit the POW block in the middle, this would stun the Koppers for a short person of time allowing them to kill them and collect points.
										Both Mario and Luigi can get hit by the Koppers and eventually die.</p>

								<h3> Sound implementation </h3>
								<p> To create the sound I used the built in SDL mixer which allowed me to access gMusic, this would then allow me to load in the music file at the launch of the game.
										The Mario theme tune will play once the player launches the game. This will continuously loop through until the player ends the game. </p>

								<h3> Menu </h3>
								<p> To create my own title screens I used a screen manager which would load the relevant screen when the player presses a button.
										To load the different screens I used a texture loader this would look for the image in the file, loading the map and other screen on to the SDL window.
										Using the screen managed I created a screen with controls on so the player could understand how to move Mario and Luigi.
										This was also used for the start screen I then further implemented a game over screen.</p>

								<p> This was a project that I did in a pair, me and another student decided to create a puzzle game within UE4.
									 	We started off by putting our ideas forwards and doing research into how to create unblock me puzzles and Simon says.
									  The first level was a tutorial maze for the player to get used to the controls, we both worked on that splitting up the level design, mechanics and UI.</p>

								<span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4rOAUzmgbE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
									<p> The second level was the level I worked on, this was an unblock me puzzles. I stated by researching into different unblock me puzzles trying to solve them along the way.

									<h3> Movement </h3>
									<p> I used the movement form the FPS template in UE4 as all I need was forwards, back, left and right. </p>

									<h3> 	Moving of blocks </h3>
									<p> I started off by creating a pick up system that would allow the player to pick up the blocks and move them around.
										  I did this with the first person template and the gun that is available.
										  I create a blueprint that would ray trace and when it hit an object it would attract that the the players gun meaning if they moved around it would follow, to fix this I had to lock the rotation and nonevent in X or Y depending on which way the clock was moving.</p>

		 						  <h3> Building of puzzles </h3>
								 	<p> To create the puzzles I created blocks that was the height of the player and used previously unblock me puzzles to create my own I had to create them then test them to see if they were solve able.
										  Once I got one puzzle set up I decide to create 3 more each getting harder as the player proceeds.
										  Once I created all the puzzles I had problem trying to complete them as the blocks where the height of the player.
										  I decide to shrink the block to a 1/3 of the size so the player would be able to jump into the centre of the puzzle and move blocks that were harder to reach.</p>

									<h3> Camera angles </h3>
									<p> The final thing I added was camera angles above the puzzle so the player could switch to them to see how they are getting on or use it as help to see what they could move next.</p>

								<h2 class="major"> Tower Defence </h2>
								<span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKRKXWlfouQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
									<p> This was an assignment where I was able to create a tower defence game in a program of my choice. I decided to do it in UE4 as I have had the most experience in it.</p>

							    <h3> AI </h3>
									 <p> I started off by creating a AI spawner this would spawn waves of enemies which would run to an end point.
										   To get them to run I first had to create a runner, this would include a behaviour tree and blackboard.
											 This would give the AI instruction in what to do, in this case they would run to my end point set up within the spawner.
											 To create different AI I created a database this would allow me to change the health, speed and the amount of money the player would get if the AI was killed. </p>

							    <h3> Towers </h3>
									 <p> To create the towers I started by creating a base actor, using a shape as the mesh.
										   As well as this I added a shooting system that uses a sphere collision to detect when a AI enters, once the AI enters the tower it will begin shooting that target until the target is killed or leaves the collision sphere.
											 I did this multiple times with different towers to do this I created a database which would allow me to alter the radius, fire rate, cost to place and how much damage the tower will deal to the AI.
											 I also included a homing and non-homing projectile. The homing projectile will hit the AI and never miss, where as the non-homing would hit and cause a splash damage effect. </p>

							   <h3> Mechanics </h3>
									<p> I had to create a method in order for the player to be able to place towers.
										  To do this I would do a check to see if there was anything under the mouse, if not the player would be able to place a tower indicated by a green outline of the tower.
											Whereas if the check comes back with a tower underneath the player won’t be able to place a tower this is then indicated with a red outline of the tower. </p>

							   <h3> Level design </h3>
									<p> I created 3 levels for my game. I had inspiration from York, Tower bridge and Stonehenge.
											With the York map I wanted it be close quarter with building hanging over the road and pavement. I also implemented a wall like the one that’s runs near the train station.
											I added my own features like a water fountain and castle gate.
											Next I created Tower bridge, this was meant to be easier than the first level as the player could see the AI running at them as they were coming from the opposite side of the bridge.
											Finally I created Stonehenge this was my hardest level as the AI was coming from every direction. This would mean the player would have to watch behind them at all times.</p>

							   <h3> Money and lives </h3>
									<p> To create the money and lives I had to create a UI that would display this to the screen. I used the AI spawner system to detect once they had reached the end point by doing this I could then edit the lives of the player.
										  Once the AI was deleted it would lower the players lives by the amount set in the database.
								    	This was kind of similar to the money situation, when I was checking if anything was under the mouse, I would take off the money set in the database when the tower was placed.
											I also did checks to see if the player had enough money to but the towers if not the button wouldn’t work. I added a feature where once the tower is placed they can’t get the money back.
											For the player to get money I had it set up for when the tower killed an AI they would gain money back also set in the database. </p>

						     <h3> Menu system </h3>
								  <p> Finally I created a start, pause, round, quit, win and lose screen.
										  The start screen would allow the player to see the controls on how to play the game, this was also set up within the pause menu in case they forgot and or want a break.
											The round screens happen before each round, it gives the player time to place down there towers before beginning the round. The quiz screen is used to quit the game.
											The lose screen happens when the player loses all the lives.
											The win screen is a bit different as the player has to survive 3 levels with 10 round within and once they complete a level they must find a door to get to the next level and to win. </p>

							<article id="FPS">
								<h2 class="major"> First person shooter </h2>
								<p> This was my FPS assignment for university. We had to make it in UE4, and we had to use a mixture of blueprints and C++. This was my first time mixing both together.

								<h3> Spawning AI </h3>
								<p> To create sparing AI I started by making a spawner which would consist of an actor.
										This would allow me to spawn a certain amount of AI with a certain radius. I set it to loop through until the max number was reached then it would stop.
										This could be changed within the blueprints. </p>

								<h3> Pickups </h3>
								<p> To create the picks up I used a mixture of blueprints and C++.
										I created a base pickup class in C++ that would detect when the player had collided with it. I give it a static mesh that could be edited in blueprint.
									 	Any other instance of that object would inherit from the base pickup class. Once the player collided with the object it would do something like adjust the players health.
									 	This would allow me to create a health pickup, speed etc. </p>

							<p>	  The health pickup would allow the player to gain back some health.
										The health was set in attributes which was a mixture of C++ and blueprints.
										This would set the players max health which was unchangeable in blueprints.
										The pickup would gift the player health if they were damaged. If the player wasn’t damaged it would do nothing, however if the player was damaged it would give the player 10 health.
										This would never go over the set max health in C++. </p>

							<p>	  Another pick up I did was speed; this would change the player speed making them faster for a short period of time.
										This was done in blueprint but was inheriting from the base pickup class.
										This would set the player speed from 600 to 1000 for a minute, once the minute was up it would return to 600 again. </p>

							<p>   I also created a double jump pickup for the player.
										When the player collided with it it would set the max jump to 2 so they could jump twice.
										Because I implemented this it meant I base my level around it. </p>

							<p>	  Finally, there was a pickup spawner which would spawn the pickups every so often.
										To do this I had to create a separate class but still using the pickup class. To change it I would add a collision box, a place holder, a spawn location, rotation, movement and a map.
										This would allow me to attach already made pickup classes. When loaded the pickups would spawn at the spawn location, begin rotating and bouncing up and down.
										Once the player collided with the collision box it would do as the pickup is set, destroy the actor and place it with a new one so many second later.</p>

							<h3> Jump pad </h3>
							<p>  For this I reused the base pickup class because it already had overlapping.
									 I then used blueprints to launch the player up for a certain distance, so the player was able to get to the next level of the game.</p>

						 <h3> Level design </h3>
						 <p>  I based my level around the ability of double jump and my jump pads.
							    This allowed me to raise platforms in the air for the player to jump around on.
							  	I placed important picks ups at these hard to reach places so the player would have to use double jump and jump pads to traverse the level.</p>

						<h3> Weapon </h3>
						<p> With the weapons we created it all in C++, all I had to do was add a mesh to the object in blueprints.
								In C++ we created 3 different weapon classes, a base class, a ray trace class and one that shoots projectiles.
							 	The bass class was just setting up the fire function which would check if left mouse had been pressed, if so, it would then fire nothing.
							 	The second class would allow me to fire ray traces at objects, if it hit an object it would display the name of it.
							  Finally, I created a 3rd class this would check if the left mouse has been clicked, if so, it will fire a projectile spawned at the muzzle location.</p>

					 <p>  I further implemented a reload system that would only allow the player to shoot the amount set in the class.
						 		This would decrease every time the player shoots until zero, once at zero the class will reload the weapon meaning the play can focus on killing the AI.</p>

					<h3> UI </h3>
					<p> To create the UI I did most of it in C++.
							I created a base HUD which is where I added the health bar and ammo.
						 	The C++ program will get the health and convert it into a percentage so it can be used in a percentage bar.
						 	Whereas for the ammo I had to convert the int into a string so I could display it in the screen.
						 	When the player loses or gains health it will update the players HUD, this will happen the same with the ammo system.</p>
