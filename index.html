					<h3 class="major"> A version of Mario </h3>
					<p> This was a recreation of an old Mario level from 1983 called Mario’s Cement Factory, which was created in Visual studios with a SDL plugin and C++. This was created over 12 weeks.</p>
					<span> <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lg5PharWOEs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>

					<h3> Characters </h3>
					<p> Mario and Luigi are created from the same class. This makes it easier in the future if I decided to add more character to the game.
							Within this character class, it gives the sprite a movement speed, facing direction, which sprite it is loading and jumping. I then created a class that connects to the character for example Mario.
							This would allow me to assign keys to move Mario around the screen, detect which way the character facing when loading into the game and when a key is pressed. It also allows me to load a sprite for the characters.<br>

					<br> With the characters having their own class it allows me to assign different key binds to move each character around the screen at the same time, this allows for the game to be multiplayer.
							The characters also has a function that allows them to collide with the POW block in the middle of the level which will stun the Koppers for a short period allowing Mario or Luigi to kill them.
							If the characters are unable to hit the Koopers while they are stunned the player will lose a life.

					<h3> Sound implementation </h3>
					<p> The sound was created using the built in SDL mixer which allows access to gMusic, this would then enable the music file to load at the launch of the game.
							The Mario theme tune will play once the player launches the game.
							The theme tune will continuously loop through until the player quits the game.</p>

					<h3> Menu </h3>
					<p> To create the different screens a screen manager class was created. This would load in the relevant screen when the player presses a button or makes it to the end.
							I created a different screen which was saved in a file within the project. This would allow me to access these through a texture loader that looked for the name of the picture within the file and load it to the screen.<br>
							<br> Some examples of the screens created are the title screen, a control screen for the player to understand how to play, a win/lose screen and finally a game over screen.</p>

				<article id="Year2">
					<h1 class="major"> Year 2 </h1>
								<h3 class="major"> First-person Shooter </h3>
								<p> This first-person shooter game was created in Unreal Engine 4 using a mixture of C++ and blueprints. This was created over 12 weeks and it was the first time at University using UE4.</p>
								<p> <em> A video of the game will appear here soon.</em> </p>

								<h3> Spawning AI </h3>
								<p> To create AI, a spawner was made which would consist of an actor.
										This would allow AI to spawn a certain amount within a set radius that can be changed in development.
										This used a For loop to loop through the AI until it reached the max number I set and it would stop spawning.
										Both these values can be changed in blueprints. </p>

								<h3> Pickups </h3>
								<p> A base pickup class was made in C++ that would detect when the player had collided with it.
										A static mesh was given so the player could see the spawner.
										Any instance of this object would inherit from the base pickup class.
										Once the player collided with the object it would adjust the player's health.
										This would allow different pickups like health, speed etc. </p>

										<h5> Health Pickup </h5>
										<p>	The health pickup would allow the player to gain back some health.
											The health was set in attributes which was a mixture of C++ and blueprints.
											It would set the player's max health which was unchangeable in blueprints.
											The pickup would gift the player 10 health if they were damaged.
											The player's health would never go over the max health set in C++. </p>

									 <h5> Speed Pickup </h5>
									 <p>	Another pick up was speed; this would change the player speed making them faster for a short period of time.
										 This was done in blueprint but was inherited from the base pickup class.
										 This would set the player speed from 600 to 1000 for a minute, once the minute was up it would return to 600 again. </p>

									<h5> Double Jump Pickup </h5>
									<p> A double jump pickup for the player was also made. When the player collided with it would set the max jump to 2 so they could double jump.  </p>

									<h5> Pickup Spawner </h5>
									<p> Finally, there was a pickup spawner which would spawn the pickups every so often.
										A separate class was made for this but still using the base pickup class.
										To change it a collision box would be made along with a place holder, a spawn location, rotation, movement and a map.
										This would allow to attach already made pickup classes. When loaded the pickups would spawn at the spawn location, begin rotating and bouncing up and down.
										Once the player collided with the collision box it would do as the pickup is set, destroy the actor and place it with a new one so many seconds later.</p>

							<h3> Jump pad </h3>
							<p> To make this the base pickup class was reused as it would allow overlapping.
								 	Blueprints were used to launch the player up for a certain distance, so the player was able to get to the next level of the game. </p>

					 		<h3> Level design </h3>
					 		<p> The level was based around the ability of double jump and jump pads.
									This allowed raised platforms in the air for the player to jump too.
									Important pickups were placed at these hard to reach places so the player would have to use double jump and jump pads to traverse the level.</p>

							<h3> Weapon </h3>
							<p> The weapons were created all in C++. A mesh was added to the object in blueprints.
							 	In C++ we created 3 different weapon classes, a base class, a ray trace class and a projectile class.
							 	The bass class was just setting up the fire function which would check if the left mouse had been pressed if so, it would then fire.
							 	The second class would allow firing ray traces at objects if it hit an object it would display the name of it.
							 	Finally, a 3rd class was made this would check if the left mouse has been clicked if so, it will fire a projectile spawned at the muzzle location.<br>

								<br> Through further implementation a reload system was made that would only allow the player to shoot the amount set in the class.
							 	This would decrease every time the player shoots until zero, once at zero the class will reload the weapon meaning the player can focus on killing the AI.</p>

						<h3> UI </h3>
						<p> Most of the UI was created in C++.
								A base HUD was made which is where the health bar and ammo would display.
								C++ program will get the health and convert it into a percentage so it can be used in a percentage bar.
								Whereas for the ammo It was converted into a string so it could display on the screen.
								When the player loses or gains health it will update the player's HUD, this will happen the same with the ammo system.</p>

					 <h3 class="major"> Tower Defence </h3>
					 <span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKRKXWlfouQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>

					 <p> This was an assignment with the key task of creating a tower defence game in a program of choice.
							 For this task, UE4 was chosen as the most experience has been gained in it. </p>

					 <p> This set task had the aim of creating a tower defence game in a program of my choice.
							 I decide to use UE4 as I have the most experience in it and I felt comfortable using the engine.

					 <h3> AI </h3>
						 <p> The AI spawner was first created. This would spawn waves of enemies which would run towards a set point.
								 To get them to run, an AI called runner was made, this would include a behaviour tree and blackboard.
								 This would give the AI instruction in what to do, in this case, they would run to the setpoint set up in the spawner.
								 To create different AI a database was made, this would enable change to the health, speed and the amount of money the player would get if the AI was killed. </p>

					 <h3> Towers </h3>
						 <p> To create the towers a base actor was implemented, using a shape as the mesh.
								 A shooting system was then made that uses a sphere collision to detect when an AI enters its radius, once the AI enters the tower it will begin shooting at that target until the target is killed or leaves the collision sphere.
								 This was done multiple times with different towers to do this a database was created which would allow alteration to the radius, fire rate, cost to place and how much damage the tower will deal with the AI.
								 There were homing and no-homing projectiles. The homing projectile will hit the AI and never miss, whereas the non-homing would hit the AI last position and cause a splash damage effect. </p>

					 <h3> Mechanics </h3>
						 <p> A mechanic was made in order for the player to place towers.
								 To do this, checks were made to see if there was anything under the mouse, if not the player would be able to place a tower indicated by a green outline around the tower.
								 Whereas if the check comes back with an object underneath the mouse the player won’t be able to place a tower this is then indicated with a red outline around the tower. </p>

					 <h3> Level design </h3>
						 <p> 3 levels were created for this game.
								 With key inspiration from York, Tower Bridge and Stonehenge.
								 With the York map, the idea was a close quarter with building hanging over the road and pavement.
								 Features like a water fountain and a castle gate were added. Tower Bridge was created, this was meant to be an easier level than the first level as the player could see the AI running at them from the other side of the bridge.
								 Finally, Stonehenge was made, this was the hardest level as the AI was coming from every direction.
								 This would mean the player would always have to watch behind them.</p>

					 <h3> Money and lives </h3>
						 <p>  To create the money and lives a UI menu was created that would display these to the screen.
									The AI spawner would detect when the AI had reached there endpoint.
									When the AI reached the endpoint, they were deleted from the game to free up memory, it would lower the player's lives by the amount set in the database. <br>

									<br> For the money situation, it would use the tower system to check if anything is below the mouse. The money is set in the database and will be taken off once the player places a tower.
											 The tower system will also check if the player has enough money to place a tower down.
											 If not, the button wouldn’t work. A feature was added where once the tower is placed, the player can’t get their money back.
											 For the player to get their money the tower would need to kill multiple AI. </p>

					 <h3> Menu system </h3>
					 <p> Finally a menu system was created whihc included a start screen, pause screen, round screen, quit screen and a win lose screen.<br><br>
						 The start screen would allow the player to see the controls on how to play the game, this was also set up within the pause menu in case they forgot or had a break.<br><br>
						 The round screens happen before each round, it gives the player time to place down their towers before beginning the round.<br><br>
						 The quit screen is used to quit the game. The lose screen happens when the player loses all their lives.<br><br>
						 The win screen is a bit different as the player must survive 3 levels with 10 rounds and once they complete a level, they must find a door to get to the next level and to win. </p>

					<h3 class="major"> Student project </h3>
					<span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fY_FY8YKPkM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
					<p> This project was done in a pair to create a puzzle game within Unreal Engine 4.
							We had some ideas and narrowed it down to different puzzle games. We created 3 levels, a maze, unblock me and a simons says.
							The first level was a tutorial level which would allow the player to get used to the controls.
							The second level was an unblock me puzzle which would use the FPS gun to attach an object to it so the player could move them around.
							The final level was the simons says. The player would go up to stalls and press a button to interact. If pressed in the right order it would open a final door.
							<br><br>

							I created the unblock me puzzel and I began doing reseach into how to use raycast to attach an object to the FPS gun.</p>

				<h3> Movement </h3>
					<p> The movement from the First Person Shooter template in UE4 was used as basic movements of forwards, back, left and right was all that was needed.</p>

				<h3> 	Moving of blocks </h3>
					<p> To begin, a pick up system was made that would allow the player to pick up the blocks and move them around.
							This was created within the first-person template and the gun that is available.
							A blueprint was created that would shoot a ray trace out of the pre-existing gun towards the moveable objects.
							If the player moved around the blocks would follow them. To fix this the rotation of the blocks needed fixing and the movement in X or Y depending on which way the blocks move.</P>

			 <h3> Building of puzzles </h3>
				<p> The puzzles blocks were created to the height of the player, this would make it harder for the player to see the solution.
						Once one puzzle was set up 3 more were developed each getting harder as the player proceeds.
						Once all the puzzles were made there were a few issues such as problems trying to complete them as the blocks were the height of the player.
						Through trial and error, the blocks were made to 1/3 of the size so the player would be able to jump into the centre of the puzzle and move blocks that were harder to reach in the middle.</p>

			<h3> Camera angles </h3>
				<p> Originally the cameras were added above the puzzles to help the player move the blocks and plan their next moves but since changing the size of the blocks the camera angles are no longer needed.</p>
