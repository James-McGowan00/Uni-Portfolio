					<h1 class="major"> Year 2 </h1>
								<h3 class="major"> First-person Shooter </h3>
								<p> This first-person shooter game was created in Unreal Engine 4 using a mixture of C++ and blueprints. This was created over 12 weeks and it was the first time at University using UE4.</p>
								<p> <em> A video of the game will appear here soon.</em> </p>

								<h3> Spawning AI </h3>
								<p> To create AI, a spawner was made which would consist of an actor.
										This would allow AI to spawn a certain amount within a set radius that can be changed in development.
										This used a For loop to loop through the AI until it reached the max number I set and it would stop spawning.
										Both these values can be changed in blueprints. </p>

								<h3> Pickups </h3>
								<p> A base pickup class was made in C++ that would detect when the player had collided with it.
										A static mesh was given so the player could see the spawner.
										Any instance of this object would inherit from the base pickup class.
										Once the player collided with the object it would adjust the player's health.
										This would allow different pickups like health, speed etc. </p>

										<h5> Health Pickup </h5>
										<p>	The health pickup would allow the player to gain back some health.
											The health was set in attributes which was a mixture of C++ and blueprints.
											It would set the player's max health which was unchangeable in blueprints.
											The pickup would gift the player 10 health if they were damaged.
											The player's health would never go over the max health set in C++. </p>

									 <h5> Speed Pickup </h5>
									 <p>	Another pick up was speed; this would change the player speed making them faster for a short period of time.
										 This was done in blueprint but was inherited from the base pickup class.
										 This would set the player speed from 600 to 1000 for a minute, once the minute was up it would return to 600 again. </p>

									<h5> Double Jump Pickup </h5>
									<p> A double jump pickup for the player was also made. When the player collided with it would set the max jump to 2 so they could double jump.  </p>

									<h5> Pickup Spawner </h5>
									<p> Finally, there was a pickup spawner which would spawn the pickups every so often.
										A separate class was made for this but still using the base pickup class.
										To change it a collision box would be made along with a place holder, a spawn location, rotation, movement and a map.
										This would allow to attach already made pickup classes. When loaded the pickups would spawn at the spawn location, begin rotating and bouncing up and down.
										Once the player collided with the collision box it would do as the pickup is set, destroy the actor and place it with a new one so many seconds later.</p>

							<h3> Jump pad </h3>
							<p> To make this the base pickup class was reused as it would allow overlapping.
								 	Blueprints were used to launch the player up for a certain distance, so the player was able to get to the next level of the game. </p>

					 		<h3> Level design </h3>
					 		<p> The level was based around the ability of double jump and jump pads.
									This allowed raised platforms in the air for the player to jump too.
									Important pickups were placed at these hard to reach places so the player would have to use double jump and jump pads to traverse the level.</p>

							<h3> Weapon </h3>
							<p> The weapons were created all in C++. A mesh was added to the object in blueprints.
							 	In C++ we created 3 different weapon classes, a base class, a ray trace class and a projectile class.
							 	The bass class was just setting up the fire function which would check if the left mouse had been pressed if so, it would then fire.
							 	The second class would allow firing ray traces at objects if it hit an object it would display the name of it.
							 	Finally, a 3rd class was made this would check if the left mouse has been clicked if so, it will fire a projectile spawned at the muzzle location.<br>

								<br> Through further implementation a reload system was made that would only allow the player to shoot the amount set in the class.
							 	This would decrease every time the player shoots until zero, once at zero the class will reload the weapon meaning the player can focus on killing the AI.</p>

						<h3> UI </h3>
						<p> Most of the UI was created in C++.
								A base HUD was made which is where the health bar and ammo would display.
								C++ program will get the health and convert it into a percentage so it can be used in a percentage bar.
								Whereas for the ammo It was converted into a string so it could display on the screen.
								When the player loses or gains health it will update the player's HUD, this will happen the same with the ammo system.</p>

					<h1> Spy Force </h1>

						<p> Spy force is currently in development.
								A simple prototype has been created that includes the basic mechanism of the game.
								The game is being made in Unity using C# for mobile devices.
								It has currently been tested on a device simulator within unity to make sure things work before downloading it to a phone to test. </p>

						<p> The game will eventually feature ads, levels that take place around the world and a unique story.
								The ads can be used for the player to gain items to unlock future levels or gain back lives.
								There will also be purchasable lives and stars that the player can buy to help them progress through the level for example more lives, unlimited lives, and stars to unlock future levels. </p>

						<img src="images/Store.png" width="100%" alt="A picture of the store system is meant to look in the game." />

						<p> The story of the game will focus on a woman called Megan Johnson as she is recruited by a secret organization that tackles high-value assignments and world-ending circumstances.
								The aim of the game is for you the player to take down the evil organization and their leader and find out their secret plan to destroy the world. </p>

						<p> The game will consist of simple controls that will allow the player to move around the screen, shoot the AI and jump around the level.
								The movement will use a joystick that is limited to left and right, but it will only appear on the screen when the player touches the screen.
								For the jump and shoot, there will be 2 buttons that will allow the player to complete these actions, more buttons could be added in the future if needed. </p>

						<p> In the prototype has a simple AI that uses a Raycast to check if there is a floor below them or not, if not the AI will turn and go in the other direction.
								Another Raycast is used to detect when the player is in a certain range and the AI will shoot the projectile to the player's last position.
								If the projectile hits the player, it will lower the player's health. The player can take 2 hits before dying and losing a life. </p>

						</video>

				  <h3> Future addition </h3>
						<p> In the future, the game is going to have a full menu system that allows the player to make purchases to help assist them through the game.
							The shooting system will be revamped and be a click and drag, that will allow the player to aim at the AI and release to fire the projectile.
							The AI will have a better aiming system and maybe a detection zone, so the player has an option to sneak around levels.
							The AI might be able to travel to different parts of the level if they hear a noise or to chase the player is, they are still in the detection zone. </p>

						</ul>

					<h2> soft Skills </h2>
					<p> I have developed the skills to create my own documentation such as design document, marketing plans and weekly forum posts.
							This has enabled me to desgin any game specifically for certain audiances and it has helped me develop my understanding of the procces of making a game.
							I am currently using GitHub for version control so that i am able to go back to previous version and make changes to my game. </p>

						<h2> Experiences </h2>
					<strong> Conferences </strong>
					<p>  I have been to the Uki student Conferences for the last 2 years.
