								<p> Assignment 2 was creating a recreation of an old Mario level from 1983 called Mario’s Cement Factory. </p>

								<h3> Characters </h3>
								<p> Mario and Luigi were created by first loading them in from a sprit sheet by creating a mesh/ texture that would load Mario and Luigi when the game launched.
										This would allow Mario and Luigi to appear on the screen when the game launched. Amongst many alterations a key alteration made was the height of the characters as they were made to be taller than in the original.
										They were also made to move with different key bindings, so 2 people can play at the same time as well as making them face in the direction the player pressed.</p>

								<h3> Movement </h3>
								<p> Movement was implemented to both Mario and Luigi which allowed them to both jump and move with individual controls.
										The jump allows both Mario and Luigi to jump to the next level to avoid the Koppers.
										With the side to side movement this allows both Mario and Luigi to wrap around the map transporting to the other side.
										Mario and Luigi both have the ability to hit the POW block in the middle, this would stun the Koppers for a short person of time allowing them to kill them and collect points.
										Both Mario and Luigi can get hit by the Koppers and eventually die.</p>

								<h3> Sound implementation </h3>
								<p> The sound was created using the built in SDL mixer which allowed access to gMusic, this would then enable the music file to load at the launch of the game.
										The Mario theme tune will play once the player launches the game.
										This will continuously loop through until the player ends the game.</p>

								<h3> Menu </h3>
								<p> To create title screens screen manager was used which would load the relevant screen when the player presses a button.
										To load the different screens a texture loader was used to look for the image in the file, loading the map and other screen on to the SDL window.
										Using the screen manager a control screen was created  so the players could understand how to move Mario and Luigi.
										This was also used for the start screen and game over screen.</p>

								<h2 class="major"> Student project </h2>
								<span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fY_FY8YKPkM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
								<p> This project was done in a pair to create a puzzle game within UE4.
										Ideas were first put forwards and research was started into how to create unblock me puzzles and Simon says.
										The first level was a tutorial maze for the player to get used to the controls.
										The second level was an unblock me puzzle research was also done to conduct this within the pair. </p>

									<h3> Movement </h3>
									<p> The movement from the First Person Shooter template in UE4 was used as basic movements of forwards, back, left and right was all that was needed.</p>

									<h3> 	Moving of blocks </h3>
									<p> To begin a pick up system was made that would allow the player to pick up the blocks and move them around.
											This  was created within the first person template and the gun that is available.
											A blueprint was created that would ray trace and when it hit an object it would attract that to the players gun meaning if they moved around it would follow,
											to fix this the rotation needed to lock and movement in X or Y depending on which way the player was moving. </p>

		 						  <h3> Building of puzzles </h3>
								 	<p> The puzzles blocks were made to the height of the player.
										 	They were created and then tested to see if they were solveable.
											 Once one puzzle was set up 3 more were developed each getting harder as the player proceeds.
											  Once all the puzzles were made there were a few issues such as problems trying to complete them as the blocks where the height of the player.
												Through trial and error the blocks were made to 1/3 of the size so the player would be able to jump into the centre of the puzzle and move blocks that were harder to reach.</p>

									<h3> Camera angles </h3>
									<p>  The final thing that was added was camera angles above the puzzle so the player could switch to them to see how they are getting on or use it as help to see what they could move next.</p>

								<h2 class="major"> Tower Defence </h2>
								<span><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKRKXWlfouQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
									<p> This was an assignment with the key task of creating a tower defence game in a program of choice.
										 	For this task UE4 was chosen as the most experience has been gained in it. </p>

							    <h3> AI </h3>
									 <p> An AI spawner was first created this would spawn waves of enemies which would run to an end point.
										 	To get them to run a runner was made, this would include a behaviour tree and blackboard.
										 	This would give the AI instruction in what to do, in this case they would run to the end point set up within the spawner.
											To create different AI a database was made, this would enable change to the health, speed and the amount of money the player would get if the AI was killed. </p>

							    <h3> Towers </h3>
									 <p> To create the towers a base actor was implemented, using a shape as the mesh.
										  	A shooting system was then made that uses a sphere collision to detect when an AI enters, once the AI enters the tower it will begin shooting that target until the target is killed or leaves the collision sphere.
												This was done multiple times with different towers to do this a database was created which would allow alteration to the radius, fire rate, cost to place and how much damage the tower will deal to the AI.
												A homing and non-homing projectile as also included in this.
												The homing projectile will hit the AI and never miss, whereas the non-homing would hit and cause a splash damage effect.  </p>

							   <h3> Mechanics </h3>
									<p> A method was needed in order for the player to be able to place towers.
										 	To do this, checks were made to see if there was anything under the mouse, if not the player would be able to place a tower indicated by a green outline around the tower.
											 Whereas if the check comes back with a tower underneath the player won’t be able to place a tower this is then indicated with a red outline around the tower. </p>

							   <h3> Level design </h3>
									<p> 3 levels were created for this game.
										With key inspiration from York, Tower bridge and Stonehenge.
										With the York map the idea was close quarter with building hanging over the road and pavement.
										Features like a water fountain and a castle gate were added. Next the Tower bridge was created, this was meant to be easier than the first level as the player could see the AI running at them as they were coming from the opposite side of the bridge.
										Finally, Stonehenge was made, this was the hardest level as the AI was coming from every direction.
										This would mean the player would always have to watch behind them.</p>

							   <h3> Money and lives </h3>
									<p>  To create the money and lives a UI was made that would display this to the screen.
											The AI spawner system was used to detect once the AI had reached the end.
										 	When the AI reached the end point, they were deleted from the game to free up memory, it would lower the players lives by the amount set in the database.
											This was like the money situation, when checking if anything was under the mouse, the money set in the database would be taken off when the tower was placed.
											Checks were also made to see if the player had enough money to put the towers down.
											If not, the button wouldn’t work. A feature was added where once the tower is placed, the player can’t get their money back.
											For the player to get their money the tower would need to kill an AI. </p>

						     <h3> Menu system </h3>
								  <p> Finally, a start, pause, round, quit, win and lose screen was implemented.
											The start screen would allow the player to see the controls on how to play the game, this was also set up within the pause menu in case they forgot and or want a break.
											The round screens happen before each round, it gives the player time to place down their towers before beginning the round.
											The quit screen is used to quit the game. The lose screen happens when the player loses all their lives.
											The win screen is a bit different as the player must survive 3 levels with 10 rounds and once they complete a level, they must find a door to get to the next level and to win. </p>

							<article id="FPS">
								<h2 class="major"> First person shooter </h2>
								<p> This was a First Person Shooter assignment for university. Which had to be made in UE4 using use a mixture of blueprints and C++. </p>

								<h3> Spawning AI </h3>
								<p> To create sparing AI a spawner was made which would consist of an actor.
										This would allow AI to spawn a certain amount with a certain radius.
										This was set to loop through until the max number was reached then it would stop.
									 	This could be changed within the blueprints. </p>

								<h3> Pickups </h3>
								<p> To create the pickups a mixture of blueprints and C++ was used.
										A base pickup class was made in C++ that would detect when the player had collided with it.
										A static mesh was given that could be edited in blueprint.
										Any other instance of that object would inherit from the base pickup class.
										Once the player collided with the object it would adjust the players health.
										This would allow a health pickup, speed etc. </p>

							<p>	  The health pickup would allow the player to gain back some health.
										The health was set in attributes which was a mixture of C++ and blueprints.
										It would set the players max health which was unchangeable in blueprints.
										The pickup would gift the player health if they were damaged.
										If the player wasn’t damaged it would do nothing, however if the player was damaged it would give the player 10 health.
										It would never go over the set max health in C++. </p>

							<p>	  Another pick up was speed; this would change the player speed making them faster for a short period of time.
										This was done in blueprint but was inheriting from the base pickup class.
										This would set the player speed from 600 to 1000 for a minute, once the minute was up it would return to 600 again. </p>

							<p> 	A double jump pickup for the player was also made. When the player collided with it would set the max jump to 2 so they could double jump.  </p>

							<p>	 Finally, there was a pickup spawner which would spawn the pickups every so often.
									 A separate class was made for this but still using the pickup class.
									 To change it a collision box would be made along with a place holder, a spawn location, rotation, movement and a map.
									 This would allow to attach already made pickup classes. When loaded the pickups would spawn at the spawn location, begin rotating and bouncing up and down.
									 Once the player collided with the collision box it would do as the pickup is set, destroy the actor and place it with a new one so many seconds later.</p>

							<h3> Jump pad </h3>
							<p>  To make this the base pickup class was reused as it would allow overlapping.
							 		 Blueprints were used to launch the player up for a certain distance, so the player was able to get to the next level of the game. </p>

						 <h3> Level design </h3>
						 <p>  The level was based around the ability of double jump and jump pads.
							 		This allowed raised platforms in the air for the player to jump around on.
									Important pickups were placed at these hard to reach places so the player would have to use double jump and jump pads to traverse the level.</p>

						<h3> Weapon </h3>
						<p>  The weapons were created all in C++, mesh was added to the object in blueprints.
								 In C++ we created 3 different weapon classes, a base class, a ray trace class and one that shoots projectiles.
								 The bass class was just setting up the fire function which would check if left mouse had been pressed, if so, it would then fire nothing.
								 The second class would allow to fire ray traces at objects, if it hit an object it would display the name of it.
								 Finally, a 3rd class was made this would check if the left mouse has been clicked, if so, it will fire a projectile spawned at the muzzle location. </p>

					 <p>  Through further implementation a reload system was made that would only allow the player to shoot the amount set in the class.
						 		This would decrease every time the player shoots until zero, once at zero the class will reload the weapon meaning the play can focus on killing the AI.</p>

					<h3> UI </h3>
					<p>  Most of the UI was created in C++.
							 A base HUD was made which is where the health bar and ammo would display.
							 C++ program will get the health and convert it into a percentage so it can be used in a percentage bar.
							 Whereas for the ammo It was converted into a string so It could display on the screen.
							 When the player loses or gains health it will update the players HUD, this will happen the same with the ammo system.</p>
